# HeadsUp
## Antelope Monitoring and Alerts

The HeadsUp Monitoring and Alerts Platform has been created by EOSphere for the Antelope Web3 community to encourage healthy infrastructure and blockchain service delivery.

HeadsUp is designed for Antelope Node Operators to run a private instance of the platform on their internal network to monitor and alert on:
- Antelope Nodeos
- Hyperion History
- Atomic Assets API

Alerts can be configured to notify via the GUI Website Frontend, Email and Slack.

HeadsUp is simple to configure and deploy with docker compose which utilises three docker containers editable in a single compose .yaml file. These containers consist of the HeadsUp Website, HeadsUp Ingestor and Postgres Database containers.

Get started with HeadsUp by following the configuration and deployment guide ->

Headsup is free for non-commercial use and we hope that it makes your Antelope DevOps life simpler through excellent visability and monitoring.
