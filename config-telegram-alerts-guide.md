This guide will cover how to configure and start receiving HeadsUp Alerts through Telegram using the Bot API. The procedure may seem a bit tricky but itâ€™s actually really simple and should only take a few minutes.

# Configure HeadsUp Telegram Alerts

Using the Telegram Bot API and configuring the HeadsUp  `docker-compose.yaml`  the steps to receiving HeadsUp Alerts via Telegram are the following:

1.  Create and Start a new Telegram Bot
2.  Create a new Alert Group and add your Telegram Bot
3.  Obtain the Group Chat ID
4.  Configure and Restart HeadsUp

# Create and Start a new Telegram Bot

Begin by connecting to BotFather the Telegram Bot API, either though a browser  [https://t.me/BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)  or searching for  `BotFather`  in Telegram.

Then create a new bot, by choosing a name and username. Take note of the Token used to access the HTTP API, save it and keep it safe.

In Telegram go to your newly created Bot and click  **START**

Add your Telegram Bot

This will be the group from where your Guild will receive all alerts and notifications from HeadsUp. Add your Guild member Telegram accounts to this group as required.

# Obtain the Group Chat ID

From within your Telegram Group run this message using your Bot username to make the  **Group Chat ID** visible.

_This is not always required, most times the Group Chat ID is instantly visible when the Bot is added to the group during creation._

`/my_id@headsup_alerts_demo_bot`

Then from a browser query the Telegram API with your saved Telegram HTTP API Token in the following format:

`https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN HERE>/getUpdates`

In this example it will look like this:

`https://api.telegram.org/bot7017987013:AAG3EzGxBn7-e_PR_nWUWx7I2EFvkvyvmDo/getUpdates`

Be sure not to forget the  `/bot`  and  `/getUpdates`  and each end of your token.

The output will have your Group Chat ID displayed as below, take note of the  **Group Chat ID**:

```
{  
      "update_id": 759577033,  
      "message": {  
        "message_id": 8,  
        "from": {  
          "id": 251151145,  
          "is_bot": false,  
          "first_name": "Ross",  
          "last_name": "(EOSphere)ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º",  
          "username": "rossco99",  
          "language_code": "en"  
        },  
        "chat": {  
          "id": -4546176026,  <-- HERE
          "title": "Demo HeadsUp Alerts",  
          "type": "group",  
          "all_members_are_administrators": true  
        },  
        "date": 1727927284,  
        "text": "/my_id@headsup_alerts_demo_bot",  
        "entities": [  
          {  
            "offset": 0,  
            "length": 30,  
            "type": "bot_command"  
          }
```

# Configure and Restart HeadsUp

Now that we have the  **HTTP API Token**  and  **Group Chat ID,** HeadsUp may be configured with your specific details as below:

```
nano docker-compose.yaml  
  
website:  
  environment:  
      - headsup_server_telegramalerts=True                                                                                                                                                                                              
      - headsup_server_telegrambot=7017987013:AAG3EzGxBn7-e_PR_nWUWx7I2EFvkvyvmDo                                                                                                                                                       
      - headsup_server_telegramchat=-4546176026
```

Restart HeadsUp:

```
docker compose up -d
```

You should now be receiving Alerts directly into your Telegram Group, ensure you add your relevant Guild members and test that all is working as expected.
